                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                          Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure that
 users interacting with the software remotely through a network have access
 to the source code of that software.

  The GNU General Public License gives everyone the freedom to run, study,
 share, and modify the software. The Affero license adds a requirement that
 users who interact with the software over a network must have the same
 rights to obtain the source code.

  Most copyleft licenses require that you provide a copy of the source code
 when you distribute the software. When you run the software on a server and
 let other users interact with it, that interaction is akin to conveying the
 software over a network. The Affero GPL ensures that those users receive the
 source code as well.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, modifying, and redistributing
 the software are described in the following sections.

                     TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
  License.

  “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,
  such as semiconductor masks.

  “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
  Each licensee is called a “user.”

  “Modify” means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion
  requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The
  resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work
  “based on” the earlier work.

  “Convey” means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or
  receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with
  no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  “Service Provider” means any party that offers the work as a service to
  users through a network.

  1. Source Code.

  The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
  modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on
  the Program and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This
  License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified
  Program. The output from running the Program is covered by this License only
  if the output, given its content, constitutes a work based on the Program.
  Otherwise, it is covered by the license that applies to the output.

  3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under
  any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright
  treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws restricting circumvention
  of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it,
  in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each
  copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices that state this
  License applies to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of warranty;
  and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it,
  provided that you meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and give
    a relevant date.

    b) The work must be licensed as a whole under this License to anyone who
    comes into possession of a copy. This License gives no permission to license
    the work under any other license.

    c) If the modified work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, they may be at the start, in the help menu,
    or accessible via a command-line option.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4
  and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source
  or make it available with an offer valid for at least three years.

  7. Additional Terms.

  “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by
  making exceptions to one or more of its conditions. Where additional permissions
  apply, they are treated as part of this License to that extent.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under
  this License. Any attempt otherwise is void. Activities under this License that
  would violate any applicable law are not allowed.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License to receive or run a copy of the Program.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license
  from the original licensors to run, modify, and propagate that work, subject to
  this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties.

  11. Patents.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license
  under the contributor’s essential patent claims to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
  import, and otherwise run, modify, and propagate the contents of their contribution.

  12. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you that contradict this License, they do not excuse you
  from the conditions. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy
  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
  obligations, then the conditions of this License are enforced.

  13. Use with the GNU General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link
  or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General
  Public License, provided that the terms of this License are met for the covered work.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised versions of the GNU Affero General
  Public License from time to time. Each version is given a distinguishing version number.
  If the Program specifies a version number of this License, you may choose that version
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not
  specify a version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
  Foundation.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
  INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
  FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT
  HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE,
  BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION
  WITH THE PROGRAM OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE PROGRAM.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program and want it covered by this License, attach a
  notice stating that you release it under version 3 of the GNU Affero General
  Public License. The notice should include a copyright notice and a short
  statement of the license, plus a link to the full license text.

  For example:

       Copyright (C) 2026  Your Name
       This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
       it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as
       published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the
       License, or (at your option) any later version.

  You should also offer a warranty disclaimer and state that this License does not
  apply to other works that may be bundled with the Program and that have separate
  licenses.
